> I have temporarily located the UPM package under my own domain (`com.varneon.vrchat-api-tools`) for accessing it via git internally and making it compatible with UPM/VPM before the source repository becomes UPM/VPM compatible.

# VRChatApiTools
 A library to interact with and extend the VRChat SDK. Doesn't do anything on its own, but provides editor tool developers with an interface to more easily interact with VRChat SDK data, and contains an alternate uploader that doesn't run in playmode.

## Requirements
- Unity 2019.4.31f1
- VRCSDK3 WORLD 2022.04.20.16.26 or later (earlier versions are untested but may work)

Documentation: soonâ„¢

For implementation examples, look at [VRBuildHelper](https://github.com/BocuD/VRBuildHelper) and [AvatarImageReader](https://github.com/Miner28/AvatarImageReader/)
